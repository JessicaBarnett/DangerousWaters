A simple game using css hover targets to activate animations

This project is very old (2014), very silly, and maybe just a little bit embarassing.  It was mostly an experiment in using css to do flash-style puppet-animation with css animations, transforms, transitions, and svgs.

There are 3 possible outcomes to this "game" - Shark, seagulls, and nessie.  See if you can find them all?
